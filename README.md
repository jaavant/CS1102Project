# Racket Animation
 
Design and implement a language for animating graphics on a canvas with racket. Graphics can move or jump around the canvas, optionally stopping when a graphic bumps into something (like an edge of the canvas or another graphic). Graphics can also be added or removed during an animation. Program also implements the use of macros.
