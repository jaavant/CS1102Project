Design and implement a language for animating graphics on a canvas with racket. Graphics can move or jump around the canvas, optionally stopping when a graphic bumps into something (like an edge of the canvas or another graphic). Graphics can also be added or removed during an animation. Here are three examples of animations. Program also implements the use of macros.
